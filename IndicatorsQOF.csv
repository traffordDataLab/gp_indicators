Identifying patients in need of palliative care, assessing their needs and preferences and proactively planning their care, are the key steps in the provision of high quality care at the end of life in general practice.

A wide range of diseases and conditions are caused by cigarette smoking, including cancers, respiratory diseases, coronary heart and other circulatory diseases, stomach and duodenal ulcers, erectile dysfunction and infertility, osteoporosis, cataracts, age-related macular degeneration and periodontitis (US Department of Health and Human Services 2004).
Women who smoke during pregnancy have a substantially higher risk of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) than those who do not smoke. Smoking can also cause complications in pregnancy and labour, including ectopic pregnancy, bleeding during pregnancy, premature detachment of the placenta and premature rupture of the membranes. Around 43 per cent of patients who smoke try to quit each year, often several times in a year. Many of these attempts fail because they are made without treatment and the aim of this indicator is to increase the proportion of quit attempts that succeed by providing best available support and treatment. The 1-year continuous abstinence rate in untreated smokers who try to quit without help is about 3 per cent.
There is evidence that when doctors and other health professionals advise on smoking cessation, and particularly when they offer support and treatment, that people are more likely to quit. Around four per cent of patients who quit without using either pharmacotherapy or behavioural support will remain abstinent at 12 months. With pharmacotherapy and brief supervision from a GP or other clinician, this would be about eight per cent.

Interventions for secondary prevention of fractures in patients who have had an osteoporotic fragility fracture include pharmacological intervention. The SIGN guideline on management of osteoporosis addresses the pharmacological management in three groups of postmenopausal women: postmenopausal women with multiple vertebral fractures (DXA scan not essential but other destructive diseases should be excluded); postmenopausal women with osteoporosis determined by DXA scan and a history of at least one vertebral fracture; and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis determined by DXA scan with or without a previous non-vertebral fracture. For all of these groups bonesparing agents are indicated to reduce subsequent fracture risk. NICE technology appraisal states that the bone-sparing agent alendronate is recommended as a treatment option for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women who are confirmed to have osteoporosis. When the decision has been made to initiate treatment with alendronate, the preparation prescribed should be chosen on the basis of the lowest acquisition cost available. The bone-sparing agents risedronate and etidronate are recommended as alternative treatment options for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women: who are unable to comply with the special instructions for the administration of alendronate, or have a contraindication to or are intolerant of alendronate and who also have a combination of T-score.
In deciding between risedronate and etidronate, clinicians and patients need to balance the overall proven effectiveness profile of the drugs against their tolerability and adverse effects in individual patients.
The SIGN clinical guideline makes recommendations on men with a diagnosis of osteoporosis determined by DXA scan. It states that to reduce fracture risk at all sites, men with low BMD and/or a history of one or more vertebral fractures or one non-vertebral osteoporotic fracture should be treated with oral alendronate.

The focus of treatment is on the cardiovascular complications of atherosclerosis (that is, managing cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure).
Two small UK studies assessing clinical risk management based on the medical records of patients with PAD suggest that these patients have poor hypertension control, use low levels of statin and antiplatelet therapy, and receive low levels of smoking cessation advice. This indicator addresses the issue of blood pressure control. The SIGN guideline on the diagnosis and management of PAD recommends that hypertensive patients with PAD should receive treatment to reduce their blood pressure. The guideline developers noted that treatment of PAD has often been considered difficult because of concerns that antihypertensive drugs, especially beta blockers, may have adverse effects on PAD (for example, possible drug-induced peripheral vasoconstriction leading to further ischaemia in the leg). The developers did not find any strong evidence to suggest that beta-blockers should not be used in the presence of PAD, although no study was sufficiently large to demonstrate an absence of adverse events with certainty.
Recommendation 2.6 in the SIGN guideline does not specify a target blood pressure in patients with PAD. However, the guideline developers considered that 140/90 mmHg is a desirable upper limit and that around one third to one half of patients with PAD would be considered hypertensive above this level. The NICE clinical guideline on Hypertension (2011) sets blood pressure thresholds for the initiation of drug treatment of hypertension and these are outlined in the rationale for the hypertension domain. All patients aged under 80 years with CVD and stage 1 hypertension (clinic blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg or higher and subsequent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) daytime average or home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) average blood pressure is 135/85 or higher) are recommended drug therapy for hypertension.

If treatment with antidepressants is initiated, patients should be followed-up regularly for several months. The NICE clinical guideline 90 recommends that ‘for people started on antidepressants who are not considered to be at increased risk of suicide, normally see them after two weeks. See them regularly thereafter, for example at intervals of two to four weeks in the first three months and then at longer intervals if the response is good. ’Early cessation of treatment is associated with a greater risk of relapse.

The guideline also suggests that a person who has benefited from taking an antidepressant should continue medication for at least six months after remission of an episode of depression. However, one study showed that only up to one-third of patients prescribed antidepressants were still receiving medication at four to six months.

Analysis of the GP Research Database for the years 1993 to 2005 has confirmed this finding: more than half of patients treated with antidepressants for a new diagnosis of depression during those years received prescriptions for only one or two months of treatment, and that this pattern had not changed over the 13 year period.

If drug treatment is not started after the initial diagnosis, patients should in any case be reassessed to see whether their symptoms have resolved or worsened to the point where treatment becomes advisable.

Recent research into the use of severity measures has shown that patients whose GPs used the measures for follow-up in addition to initial assessment valued having repeated scores to help monitor their progress and assess the effectiveness of treatment. Most of the GPs interviewed for the same study believed that there was value in repeating the score as a way of monitoring patients’ progress.

The report recommends that national organisations and local government departments that influence public health should continue to develop and support population-level initiatives to reduce the risk of dementia by making it easier for people to achieve and/ or maintain a healthy weight (recommendation 1). https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng16 The report recognises that mid-life is not the only time to make changes, and that these issues are important throughout life: the earlier healthy behaviours are adopted the more likely a person is to have more years free from illness, disability and frailty. The Blackfriars Consensus publication (2014) states that given the evidence that there may be a vascular component to many dementias; interventions to reduce vascular risk factors such as obesity should also help reduce the risk, progression and severity of dementia. http://nhfshare.heartforum.org.uk/RMAssets/Reports/Blackfriars%20consensus%20%20_V18.pdf The ambition is to reduce the number of people who are obese which in turn could reduce the population risk of dementia.","Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF), NHS Digital",NA,"Data for 2017/18 can be downloaded from  https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/quality-and-outcomes-framework-achievement-prevalence-and-exceptions-data/2017-18

Warfarin in particular is under used for stroke prevention in AF. A NICE costing report accompanying the recommendations for AF treatment in 2006 estimated that nationally 355,312 patients with AF should be on warfarin (i.e. all of those assessed as high risk, half of those at moderate risk and none of those at low risk, using the NICE stroke risk stratification algorithm and if not contraindicated), or an additional 165,946 patients who were not receiving this treatment – almost 50 per cent of those estimated as requiring warfarin. Therefore there is clearly a need to encourage the use of this treatment for AF patients at high risk of stroke. Furthermore, recent evidence from the BAFTA trial and the ACTIVE-W135 study suggests not only is warfarin much more effective than aspirin, but that it is not as unsafe – in terms of risk of serious haemorrhage – as previously thought (though it would be useful to ascertain if these findings are replicated elsewhere using an appropriate meta-analysis).",QOF,NA,"Data for 2017/18 can be downloaded from  https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/quality-and-outcomes-framework-achievement-prevalence-and-exceptions-data/2017-18
